# CSS FLEX

This activity involves creating responsive layouts for different scenarios using CSS Flexbox. It is divided into five sections, with each section focusing on a unique layout designed with Flexbox in HTML.

# Home page

In this page, Flexbox is used to create a responsive and well-aligned layout. The navbar items are spaced evenly and centered vertically using Flexbox. The hero section's heading, paragraph, and call-to-action button are vertically and horizontally centered. The featured cars section uses Flexbox to display product cards in a flexible, responsive grid that wraps as needed. Product cards are aligned within their container and distributed with gaps between them. The contact form section stacks its elements vertically and centers them within the container, ensuring a neat and organized presentation on all screen sizes.

# Product Page 

In the product layout, Flexbox is used to align .product-card elements in a flexible row or grid, ensuring even spacing and proper alignment across the page. It provides a responsive design by allowing the cards to wrap onto the next line as the screen size decreases. Flexbox also centers content within each .product-card, aligning images, headings, paragraphs, and buttons both vertically and horizontally.

# Profile Page 

In the profile.html page, Flexbox is used to create a flexible and responsive layout for profile cards.

The .contact-form section ensures proper alignment of form elements and adapts for smaller screens. The .footer section centers the copyright text. Overall, Flexbox ensures a clean, responsive, and well-aligned layout across devices.
